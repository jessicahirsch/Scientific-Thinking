## What's Science Got to Do with It?
I once heard someone say, “science is the great equalizer.” When I began studying software engineering 7 years ago, after transitioning as a biology major and from within the sciences, I leaned on the scientific method to probe and engage with foreign topics, like Node.js debugging and cross-origin site errors. Computers have a science, after all.

Unknown at the time, scientific thinking has deep roots in sibling areas of engineering, like site reliability and DevOps. Perhaps that's why I have found partnerships in SRE teams, whether sought out or by happenstance. Quality engineering has meaningful ties to "Lean" and continuous improvement practices. I enjoy applying these problem solving techniques as I build my work, skills and self in this field.
