## Cypress 101
Cypress is a friendly, frontend testing tool that resembles legacy testing tools like Selenium. It can test anything that runs in a browser. Published tests may be small and omit any dependencies.

### What does Cypress Offer?
Cypress comes complete with a built-in test runner, a Cloud environment, video recordings and test replays to closely examine reported failures.

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
